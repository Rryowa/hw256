Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC), a novel cache management policy designed for demand paging systems.  

The goal of ARC is to improve cache performance by dynamically balancing between recency and frequency in an online, self-tuning manner

ARC consistently outperforms LRU and performs comparably to more complex algorithms like LRU-2, 2Q, LRFU, and LIRS, even when these algorithms use the best offline tuning parameters:
